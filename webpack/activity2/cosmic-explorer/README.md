# Activity 2- Demonstrate the full range of WebPack's functionalities
# Cosmic Explorer

## Overview

### For This Activity

Now that we have seen some basic benefits and functionalitites that Webpack provides, in this activity we will build a more complex website than in Activity 1, demonstrating the full use of webpack by working with a project that includes multiple CSS files, static assets, JavaScript, and HTML files.

### Brief of the Website

**Cosmic Explorer** features an interactive gallery of celestial objects, including planets, stars, and galaxies. Each object has detailed information and dynamically loaded facts available upon user interaction.

### Multiple Folders Structure

The project structure consists of various folders that separate concerns such as styles, scripts, utilities, images, and fonts. This modular approach keeps the codebase organized but also highlights how complex projects can become without a build tool like webpack.

### How to Clone and Run It

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tpaidi/SER598-build-tools-tutorial.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd webpack/activity2/cosmic-explorer
   ```
3. Open `index.html`

Explore the website and get a feel for it and all it's functionalities.

Right now this is very inefficient, in the next activity we will use Webpack to imporve it
